# The series, 1^1 + 2^2 + 3^3 + ... + 10^10 = 10405071317.
#
# Find the last ten digits of the series, 1^1 + 2^2 + 3^3 + ... + 1000^1000.
#
# Approach: When going above a certain threshold, adding more exponentials to the sum should no longer
# impact the last ten digits. Find that threshold and just sum until it has been reached.
